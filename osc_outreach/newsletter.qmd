## Create a newsletter

For creating the newsletter you can copy one of the last ones (click on the three dots and then “make a copy”), so the design is standardized.

Things to standardize:

- Date (e.g. Jan 8, vs Jan. 8, vs Jan 8, 2024 and other variation)
- Time (e.g. 14:00 vs 2pm or missing)
- Titles (e.g. Prof. Dr.)
- Spacing between titles and text
- Continuous numbering of titles
- Justification of text (this means aligned both sides)
- Amounts of money (e.g. 500.000 € vs other formats)
- Event info, order and type of info.
- Check links are all working
