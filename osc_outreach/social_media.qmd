## Administration

Create personal profile on BlueSky, Mastodon, LinkedIn to be linked in the OSC profile pages. 

If you don’t want this, you can also log in with the OSC account and we only indicate your name in the profile page of this account (for accountability). 

Ask Malika to give you access to the credentials for the following OSC accounts:

- LinkedIn (lim: 3000): https://www.linkedin.com/company/91742131/admin/feed/posts/
- Bluesky (lim: 300): https://bsky.app/profile/lmu-osc.bsky.social/post/3kbhybwivz22q
- Mastodon (lim: 500): https://scicomm.xyz/home
- X is deactivated

The OSC publishes different **categories of posts** on social media:

- Research work from members (e.g. articles)
- Information about various aspects of open science 
- Upcoming events for open science community
- Campaigns for making open science topics more visible

Your main ideas and plans when to publish any campaigns will get into the [main Social Media doc](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/18aIg0UEzhhkycSRIPZLNTflnXUX-H0kaBzMa-dC3V_8/edit)

When you create longer texts or campaigns, create a separate Google doc for that and work in there (?)

Use insights from social media (especially LinkedIn) to scope for new potential members (e.g. view the follower list, see those who liked and commented)
