    "text": "Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.\nUsing Creative Commons Public Licenses\nCreative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.\n\n\n\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (“Public License”). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\n\nAdapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\nAdapter’s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nBY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\nCopyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\nEffective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\nExceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\nLicense Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.\nLicensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\nLicensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\nLicensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\nShare means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\nSui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\nYou means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense grant.\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\nA. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\nB. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\nExceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\nTerm. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\nMedia and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\nDownstream recipients.\nA. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nB. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.\nC. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\nNo endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\nOther rights.\n\nMoral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\nPatent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\nAttribution.\n\nIf You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\nA. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\nidentification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\na copyright notice;\na notice that refers to this Public License;\na notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\na URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\nB. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\nC. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\nYou may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\nIf requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\nShareAlike.\n\nIn addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\nThe Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\nYou must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter’s License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\nYou may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter’s License You apply.\n\n\n\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\nif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\nYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\n\n\nUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\nTo the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the “Licensor.” The text of the Creative Commons public licenses is dedicated to the public domain under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication.

The following chapters will introduce you to the basics of the lmu-osc/tutorial-template which standardizes the design of our websites, the licensing, the citation styles used, and more to provide a coherent structure across our growing catalogue of tutorials. In particular, the chapters are organized as follows:\n\nTutorial Template Overview introduces the major files and folders in the tutorial, and briefly describes the purpose of each of them.\nThings You Shouldn’t Change provides some warnings about files that should only be changed in extenuating circumstances, and how to go about doing so.\nGetting Started outlines the technical steps needed to get started with a new tutorial\nMatomo Analytics discusses our website data analytics tool, and how to include the necessary tracking code in the website.\nAuthoring and Versions covers in greater detail when and how to make updates to your project, with particular attention paid to GitHub releases and versioning of the project.\nBest Practices discusses some best practices when developing your tutorial. These are largely recommendations. (Chapter not developed yet–questioning content.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote on Authoring Practices, Writing Style, and Formatting\n\n\n\nWe do not prescribe how or what tutorial authors should write, obviously as long as content is within the scope of the tutorial topic.\nFeel free to stylize your content to your liking, and take advantage of Quarto features, Markdown features, and code embedded in the documents as your see fit.\nYou can, as always, tag an OSC member for review or help in pull requests or issues!\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "One of the primary objectives of the OSC is to braoden both knowledge and practice of open science, and the online tutorials we offer are a cornerstone of this initiative. In that regard, some tutorials were brought over by our staff members from previous research institutions, and several more were commissioned between approximately 2021 and 2025.\nWhile the content from these tutorials was designed and/or adapted to fit in with the other tutorials to create a logical learning flow, the tutorials were not technically standardized. That is, the licenses, HTML/CSS formatting, citation styles, and so on were not consistent between projects. Towards the end of 2024 and through 2025 we worked to align our existing tutorials as much as possible on these issues, but this was a significant amount of work.\nWanting to avoid a repeat of this process in the future, we established a templated GitHub repository, lmu-osc/tutorial-template with all of the default settings and files we wish to have applied to our projects going forward. The core contents of this repo are generally intended to be prescriptive when creating new tutorials, outside of deciding what content should be included in the tutorial itself. Let’s explore this in more detail below.",

    "section": "Important Files and Folders",
    "text": "Important Files and Folders\n\n.gitignore\nIf you’re not familiar with .gitignore files, I recommend taking a look at this overview.\nThe included ignore file for the tutorials is a modified version of GitHub’s template for R projects with some additions to ignore Quarto specific files, namely the _site folder. Some people push this folder to their GitHub repo, and use it to serve their website from. However, we have a CI/CD workflow that will automatically render the website and serve it from the gh-pages branch.\nFor Mac users, any .DS_Store files are also automatically ignored–those should never be tracked in a git project anyway as they are local indexing files for searching the system. (Tip: run the R function usethis::git_vaccinate() if you want to globally ignore a handful of annoying files, namely .Rproj.user, .Rhistory, .Rdata, .httr-oauth, .DS_Store, and .quarto.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.gitignore File Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n# History files\n.Rhistory\n.Rapp.history\n\n# Session Data files\n.RData\n.RDataTmp\n\n# User-specific files\n.Ruserdata\n\n# Example code in package build process\n*-Ex.R\n\n# Output files from R CMD build\n/*.tar.gz\n\n# Output files from R CMD check\n/*.Rcheck/\n\n# RStudio files\n.Rproj.user/\n\n# produced vignettes\nvignettes/*.html\nvignettes/*.pdf\n\n# OAuth2 token, see https://github.com/hadley/httr/releases/tag/v0.3\n.httr-oauth\n\n# knitr and R markdown default cache directories\n*_cache/\n/cache/\n\n# Temporary files created by R markdown\n*.utf8.md\n*.knit.md\n\n# R Environment Variables\n.Renviron\n\n# pkgdown site\ndocs/\n\n# translation temp files\npo/*~\n\n# RStudio Connect folder\nrsconnect/\n\n# Quarto\n/.quarto/\n\n# Future-proofing: ignore commonly included files that should not be tracked\n# Inspired by usethis::git_vaccinate() options\n.DS_Store\n.Rproj.user\n.httr-oauth\n.quarto\n_site/\n\n# Tutorials should pull custom.scss from our central branding repo\nlmu-osc-custom.scss\n\n\n\n\n\n.github/workflows\nThe two files contained in this directory, citation-check.yml and publish.yml, are yaml files for GitHub Actions that should run in your tutorials. The first action file checks that the formatting of your CITIATION.cff file meets requirements, and the publish.yml waits for changes on the main git branch then renders the whole website to the gh-pages branch in the repo.\nBoth workflows are from commonly available templates, but I have modified the publish.yml to have some additional executuion instructions depending on whether or not the {renv} package is used in your project. (If you have any R code included, then please do use {renv}.)\nA later chapter will talk about how to manually run these pipelines if you need/want to for any reason, and will go into more detail on the code. However, 95% of the time you will not need to make any changes to these pipelines. Just be aware that they exist, and they are doing things that should make your life easier.\n\n\nCITATION.cff\n\nBackground: Citation File Format\nThere is fairly extensive documentation online for Citation File Format, but, in short, it is a standardized method for writing citation files in a yaml format. There are hundreds of different “fields” that can be filled out like DOIs, ORCIDs, author information, institution information, and so on.\n\n\nWhy?\nThis file ultimately has three main uses for our projects:\n\nThey are needed for automated processing and the DOI generation procedure we use with Zenodo.\nGitHub recognizes these files, and will create a citation for us directly in the repo. (Not as a file, but check out the “Cite this repository” button on the right-hand side of the repository home.)\nThis helps prepare the information that goes into the about.qmd file, discussed later.\n\n\n\nOur File\nThe current version of the CITATION.cff file is listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCITATION.cff File Contents\n\n\n\n\n\ncff-version: 1.2.0\nmessage: \"If you use this software, please cite it as below.\"\nauthors:\n- family-names: \"YOUR_NAME_HERE\"\n  given-names: \"YOUR_NAME_HERE\"\n  orcid: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000\"\n- family-names: \"Lisa\"\n  given-names: \"Mona\"\n  orcid: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000\"\ntitle: \"\"\nversion: 0.0.1\ndoi: \ndate-released: YYYY-MM-DD\nrepository-code: \"https://github.com/lmu-osc/\"\nurl: \"https://github.com/lmu-osc/\"\n\n\n\nFields you should pay attention to or fill out:\n\nauthors should be completed with your family (last) name, given (first) name, and an ORCID for all authors. Remove the ORCID field if you do not have one.\ntitle should be replaced with the name of the tutorial\nversion should begin with 0.0.1 following typical semantic versioning rules. Do not increase this until after making the initial Zenodo connection (discussed in a later chapter).\ndoi will remain empty inititally, but can be filled out after connecting with Zenodo\ndata-released should be the date that the current version of the repo was released\nrepository-code should be the link directly to the GitHub repository of the project\nurl should be the address for the actual websige i.e. the GitHub Pages\n\n\n\n\nLICENSES\nOur standard licenses are CC-BY-SA 4.0 for the written text and CC-0 for code contained within the tutorials. These license files are contained in LICENSE.md and LICENSE-CODE.md respectively.\n\n\nREADME.md\nThis file should follow the typical conventions of a README file in that it provides a brief overview of the project, and any particular specifications on running code or downloading additional softwares as needed.\nOtherwise, we have no strong recommendations on what to include in this file other the Zenodo DOI badge at the top of the file. (Again, this is discussed in a later chapter.)\n\n\nTOPIC* Directories\nThese two directories are just example/template spaces for where you should store your Quarto (.qmd) files. In general, we anticipate that the tutorials will be divided into 2-5 broad sections, and each section will be represented by one of these folders.

    "text": "When to version?\n\nMoving Beyond v0.0.1\nIf you followed the earlier instructions, the initial version of your project should always be v0.0.1. This version contains essentially no content, and only some technical/set-up files. But what should constitute your first “release” after this? When have you moved up a version?\nYou could, for example, increment the patch numbers to e.g. v0.0.2, v0.0.3, … as you add and refine sections or chapters to your tutorial. However, this becomes tedious, and doesn’t reflect the reality of jumping between chapters as we develop, expanding upon and deleting chapters, and so on.\nMy rule of thumb is, in the early and initial stages of development, that it’s okay to be a little bit fast and dirty with the versioning: only bother to reversion when you are at the point that your first minor release, i.e. v0.1.0, seems like it would be reasonable. And a minor release is probably reasonable around the time that you would ask another OSC member to review a (nearly) completed draft.\n\n\nMoving Beyond v0.1.X\nAt the stage of v0.1.X, there will likely be several rounds of review and refinement. How and when should reviews be incremented?\n\nPatches: if primarily text, grammar, and other small adjustments are made to the tutorial, increment by just a patch.\nMinor: if large chunks of a chapter or chapters are added, removed, or relocated, increment by a minor release.\nMajor: the first major release should occur around the time the tutorial goes live for e.g. the first workshop. This might not hold universally, but is a good rule-of-thumb for when a tutorial is “finalized.”",

If you need to change this workflow file, it should only be because there is genuinely an issue with the configuration or if a dependency is not installed.\nMissing system dependencies may particularly be a problem for now because, at the time of writing this in early 2025, GitHub recently changed their latest Ubuntu image to 24.04 and stripped away some dependencies that they included in the 22.02 image.\nYou’re welcome to adjust or create your own publish workflow if needed, or you can contact staff at the OSC for help.\n\n\nThe .gitignore\nThis has been set-up to ignore annoying or unneeded components of R projects/packages, Quarto projects, and files that are commonly included in repositories even though they should not be. Feel free to add more files to the .gitignore if something specific needs to be blocked or ignored, but, in general, you should not delete items from this file.\n\n\nThe _quarto.yml File\nWe aim for our tutorials to have a standard look and feel, and the _quarto.yml file is a big part of that. If you need to change this file beyond the required adjustments mentioned in previous chapters, please contact staff at the OSC for help. We’re always open for improvements to the design, but we do want to make sure any changes get applied across all tutorials.\n\n\nThe LICENSE Files\nThe license files are there to protect the intellectual property of the authors and the OSC, and should not be changed unless there are legal reasons or extenuating circumstances to do so. If you have questions about the license, please contact staff at the OSC. We’re currently working on documentation that outlines our licensing decisions in greater detail.\n\n\nThe CITATION File\nThe CITATION file is there to help others cite your work, and we have tried to select useful fields provided by the Citation File Format. As with the _quarto.yml file, we’re open to suggestions if more fields should be added, but please contact staff at the OSC before making changes.\n\n\nThe About Page\nThe yaml header in the About page is also standardized to approximately align with the CITATION file, but Quarto does not align exactly with CFF so you cannot simply copy/paste the CITATION file contents to this section.\nThe main content of the About page can be altered to add contributors notes and any other relevant authoring information that cannot be included as metadata in the yaml field. Please do not remove or change the notes about licensing on this page.\nIf you have cited other sources in your tutorial and created a bibliography, please reference the bibliography in the yaml header of this page with e.g. bibliography: your_bib_file.bib\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

The CC BY-SA 4.0 license is for the content of the website, while the CC0 1.0 Universal license is for the code and configuration files. This is a common practice for websites that include code snippets and other content that may be reused in other projects, particularly because the CC BY-SA 4.0 license is not intended to be used with software.\n\n\nNotes\nThis tutorial was primarily written in YYYY using SOFTWARE-NAME SOFTWARE-VERSION. Major changes to the SOFTWARE-NAME can be found at the package’s website for the most up-to-date information, and to confirm that our tutorial is not out-of-date.\n\n\n\n\n Back to topCitationBibTeX citation:@online{1,\n  author = {1, AUTHOR and 2, AUTHOR},\n  title = {TITLE {HERE}},\n  date = {},\n  url = {https://lmu-osc.github.io/introduction-to-renv},\n  doi = {DOI HERE},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\n1, AUTHOR, and AUTHOR 2. n.d. “TITLE HERE.” LMU Open\nScience Center. https://doi.org/DOI\nHERE."
