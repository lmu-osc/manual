These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n\nCopyright and Related Rights.

Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\nPublic License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”).

In the GitHub repo for your project, navigate to the Visibility option in the settings, and change to public. Then, repeat Step 3.\n\n\n\nClone the new repository\nIf you are going to use RStudio with your project, create a new RStudio project while on the main branch. Commit this .RProj file and push to GitHub immediately.\nRun the command quarto publish gh-pages at the terminal, and agree to publish the site.\n\nThis will automatically activate GitHub Pages on the repo, and set the site to be deployed from the gh-pages branch on GitHub.\n\nRemove the gh-pages branch from your local computer with git branch -D gh-pages. You should not be making direct edits to this branch as it is updated by the CI/CD pipeline for publishing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can check the status of the website deployment by navigating to Actions in the repo. A green checkbox indicates succesful deployment. Your terminal may or may not continue to display “Deploying gh-pages branch to website (this may take a few minutes).” If your deloyment was successful, you can simply use “Cmd+C” to exit the loop.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "A more accurate title for this page would be “Things You Shouldn’t Change Without a Good Reason.” The following are some of the things you should be careful about changing in the project:\n\nThe GitHub Action Files\nThe publishing workflow should work out of the box for Quarto projects, and for projects that are combined with R (with or without {renv}–but please do use {renv} if your project uses R). If you need to change this workflow file, it should only be because there is genuinely an issue with the configuration or if a dependency is not installed.\nMissing system dependencies may particularly be a problem for now because, at the time of writing this in early 2025, GitHub recently changed their latest Ubuntu image to 24.04 and stripped away some dependencies that they included in the 22.02 image.\nYou’re welcome to adjust or create your own publish workflow if needed, or you can contact staff at the OSC for help.\n\n\nThe .gitignore\nThis has been set-up to ignore annoying or unneeded components of R projects/packages, Quarto projects, and files that are commonly included in repositories even though they should not be. Feel free to add more files to the .gitignore if something specific needs to be blocked or ignored, but, in general, you should not delete items from this file.\n\n\nThe _quarto.yml File\nWe aim for our tutorials to have a standard look and feel, and the _quarto.yml file is a big part of that. If you need to change this file beyond the required adjustments mentioned in previous chapters, please contact staff at the OSC for help. We’re always open for improvements to the design, but we do want to make sure any changes get applied across all tutorials.\n\n\nThe LICENSE Files\nThe license files are there to protect the intellectual property of the authors and the OSC, and should not be changed unless there are legal reasons or extenuating circumstances to do so. If you have questions about the license, please contact staff at the OSC. We’re currently working on documentation that outlines our licensing decisions in greater detail.\n\n\nThe CITATION File\nThe CITATION file is there to help others cite your work, and we have tried to select useful fields provided by the Citation File Format. As with the _quarto.yml file, we’re open to suggestions if more fields should be added, but please contact staff at the OSC before making changes.\n\n\nThe About Page\nThe yaml header in the About page is also standardized to approximately align with the CITATION file, but Quarto does not align exactly with CFF so you cannot simply copy/paste the CITATION file contents to this section.\nThe main content of the About page can be altered to add contributors notes and any other relevant authoring information that cannot be included as metadata in the yaml field. Please do not remove or change the notes about licensing on this page.\nIf you have cited other sources in your tutorial and created a bibliography, please reference the bibliography in the yaml header of this page with e.g. bibliography: your_bib_file.bib\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "When to version?\n\nMoving Beyond v0.0.1\nIf you followed the earlier instructions, the initial version of your project should always be v0.0.1. This version contains essentially no content, and only some technical/set-up files. But what should constitute your first “release” after this? When have you moved up a version?\nYou could, for example, increment the patch numbers to e.g. v0.0.2, v0.0.3, … as you add and refine sections or chapters to your tutorial. However, this becomes tedious, and doesn’t reflect the reality of jumping between chapters as we develop, expanding upon and deleting chapters, and so on.\nMy rule of thumb is, in the early and initial stages of development, that it’s okay to be a little bit fast and dirty with the versioning: only bother to reversion when you are at the point that your first minor release, i.e. v0.1.0, seems like it would be reasonable. And a minor release is probably reasonable around the time that you would ask another OSC member to review a (nearly) completed draft.\n\n\nMoving Beyond v0.1.X\nAt the stage of v0.1.X, there will likely be several rounds of review and refinement. How and when should reviews be incremented?\n\nPatches: if primarily text, grammar, and other small adjustments are made to the tutorial, increment by just a patch.\nMinor: if large chunks of a chapter or chapters are added, removed, or relocated, increment by a minor release.\nMajor: the first major release should occur around the time the tutorial goes live for e.g. the first workshop. This might not hold universally, but is a good rule-of-thumb for when a tutorial is “finalized.”",

    "text": "One of the primary objectives of the OSC is to braoden both knowledge and practice of open science, and the online tutorials we offer are a cornerstone of this initiative. In that regard, some tutorials were brought over by our staff members from previous research institutions, and several more were commissioned between approximately 2021 and 2025.\nWhile the content from these tutorials was designed and/or adapted to fit in with the other tutorials to create a logical learning flow, the tutorials were not technically standardized. That is, the licenses, HTML/CSS formatting, citation styles, and so on were not consistent between projects. Towards the end of 2024 and through 2025 we worked to align our existing tutorials as much as possible on these issues, but this was a significant amount of work.\nWanting to avoid a repeat of this process in the future, we established a templated GitHub repository, lmu-osc/tutorial-template with all of the default settings and files we wish to have applied to our projects going forward. The core contents of this repo are generally intended to be prescriptive when creating new tutorials, outside of deciding what content should be included in the tutorial itself. Let’s explore this in more detail below.",

    "text": "Important Files and Folders\n\n.gitignore\nIf you’re not familiar with .gitignore files, I recommend taking a look at this overview.\nThe included ignore file for the tutorials is a modified version of GitHub’s template for R projects with some additions to ignore Quarto specific files, namely the _site folder. Some people push this folder to their GitHub repo, and use it to serve their website from. However, we have a CI/CD workflow that will automatically render the website and serve it from the gh-pages branch.\nFor Mac users, any .DS_Store files are also automatically ignored–those should never be tracked in a git project anyway as they are local indexing files for searching the system. (Tip: run the R function usethis::git_vaccinate() if you want to globally ignore a handful of annoying files, namely .Rproj.user, .Rhistory, .Rdata, .httr-oauth, .DS_Store, and .quarto.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote.gitignore File Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n# History files\n.Rhistory\n.Rapp.history\n\n# Session Data files\n.RData\n.RDataTmp\n\n# User-specific files\n.Ruserdata\n\n# Example code in package build process\n*-Ex.R\n\n# Output files from R CMD build\n/*.tar.gz\n\n# Output files from R CMD check\n/*.Rcheck/\n\n# RStudio files\n.Rproj.user/\n\n# produced vignettes\nvignettes/*.html\nvignettes/*.pdf\n\n# OAuth2 token, see https://github.com/hadley/httr/releases/tag/v0.3\n.httr-oauth\n\n# knitr and R markdown default cache directories\n*_cache/\n/cache/\n\n# Temporary files created by R markdown\n*.utf8.md\n*.knit.md\n\n# R Environment Variables\n.Renviron\n\n# pkgdown site\ndocs/\n\n# translation temp files\npo/*~\n\n# RStudio Connect folder\nrsconnect/\n\n# Quarto\n/.quarto/\n\n# Future-proofing: ignore commonly included files that should not be tracked\n# Inspired by usethis::git_vaccinate() options\n.DS_Store\n.Rproj.user\n.httr-oauth\n.quarto\n_site/\n\n# Tutorials should pull custom.scss from our central branding repo\nlmu-osc-custom.scss\n\n\n\n\n\n.github/workflows\nThe two files contained in this directory, citation-check.yml and publish.yml, are yaml files for GitHub Actions that should run in your tutorials. The first action file checks that the formatting of your CITIATION.cff file meets requirements, and the publish.yml waits for changes on the main git branch then renders the whole website to the gh-pages branch in the repo.\nBoth workflows are from commonly available templates, but I have modified the publish.yml to have some additional executuion instructions depending on whether or not the {renv} package is used in your project. (If you have any R code included, then please do use {renv}.)\nA later chapter will talk about how to manually run these pipelines if you need/want to for any reason, and will go into more detail on the code. However, 95% of the time you will not need to make any changes to these pipelines. Just be aware that they exist, and they are doing things that should make your life easier.\n\n\nCITATION.cff\n\nBackground: Citation File Format\nThere is fairly extensive documentation online for Citation File Format, but, in short, it is a standardized method for writing citation files in a yaml format. There are hundreds of different “fields” that can be filled out like DOIs, ORCIDs, author information, institution information, and so on.\n\n\nWhy?\nThis file ultimately has three main uses for our projects:\n\nThey are needed for automated processing and the DOI generation procedure we use with Zenodo.\nGitHub recognizes these files, and will create a citation for us directly in the repo. (Not as a file, but check out the “Cite this repository” button on the right-hand side of the repository home.)\nThis helps prepare the information that goes into the about.qmd file, discussed later.\n\n\n\nOur File\nThe current version of the CITATION.cff file is listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCITATION.cff File Contents\n\n\n\n\n\ncff-version: 1.2.0\nmessage: \"If you refer to this tutorial, please cite it as below.\"\nauthors:\n- family-names: \"YOUR_NAME_HERE\"\n  given-names: \"YOUR_NAME_HERE\"\n  orcid: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000\"\n  affiliation:\n    - name: \"INCLUDE RELEVANT INSTITUTION\"\n      ror: \"INCLUDE ROR LINK ID IF AVAILABLE\"\n    - name: \"INCLUDE RELEVANT INSTITUTION\"\n      ror: \"INCLUDE ROR LINK ID IF AVAILABLE\"\ntitle: \"TUTORIAL_TITLE_HERE\"\nversion: 0.0.1\ndoi: \"DOI_HERE_AFTER_GENERATED\"\ndate-released: YYYY-MM-DD\nrepository-code: \"https://github.com/lmu-osc/TUTORIAL_REPO\"\nurl: \"https://lmu-osc.github.io/TUTORIAL_REPO/\"\npreferred-citation:\n  authors:\n    - family-names: \"YOUR_LAST_NAME_HERE\"\n      given-names: \"YOUR_FIRST_NAME_HERE\"\n      orcid: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000\"\n    - family-names: \"Carberry\"\n      given-names: \"Josiah\"\n      orcid: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097\"\n  title: \"TUTORIAL_TITLE_HERE\"\n  year: YYYY\n  doi: \"10.1000/182\"\n  publisher:\n    name: \"LMU Open Science Center\"\n    ror: \"https://ror.org/029e6qe04\"\n  repository-code: \"https://github.com/lmu-osc/TUTORIAL_REPO\"\n  url: \"https://lmu-osc.github.io/TUTORIAL_REPO/\"\n  type: \"book\"\n\n\n\nFields you should pay attention to or fill out:\n\nauthors should be completed with your family (last) name, given (first) name, and an ORCID for all authors. Remove the ORCID field if you do not have one.\ntitle should be replaced with the name of the tutorial\nversion should begin with 0.0.1 following typical semantic versioning rules. Do not increase this until after making the initial Zenodo connection (discussed in a later chapter).\ndoi will remain empty inititally, but can be filled out after connecting with Zenodo\ndata-released should be the date that the current version of the repo was released\nrepository-code should be the link directly to the GitHub repository of the project\nurl should be the address for the actual websige i.e. the GitHub Pages\n\n\n\n\nLICENSES\nOur standard licenses are CC-BY-SA 4.0 for the written text and CC-0 for code contained within the tutorials. These license files are contained in LICENSE.md and LICENSE-CODE.md respectively.\n\n\nREADME.md\nThis file should follow the typical conventions of a README file in that it provides a brief overview of the project, and any particular specifications on running code or downloading additional softwares as needed.\nOtherwise, we have no strong recommendations on what to include in this file other the Zenodo DOI badge at the top of the file. (Again, this is discussed in a later chapter.)\n\n\nTOPIC* Directories\nThese two directories are just example/template spaces for where you should store your Quarto (.qmd) files. In general, we anticipate that the tutorials will be divided into 2-5 broad sections, and each section will be represented by one of these folders. Each section will contain chapters which are independent Quarto files stored within their respective folders.\nThis image illustrates how “TOPIC1” and “TOPIC2” are the different “sections” of the tutorial while the Quarto files are the different chapters.\n\n\n├── TOPIC1\n│   ├── page1.qmd\n│   └── page2.qmd\n├── TOPIC2\n│   ├── page1.qmd\n│   ├── page2.qmd\n│   ├── page3.qmd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that placing the chapter files in the respective folders will not automatically organize them into that location. You must specify which files are rendered, and where they are located in the _quarto.yml file.\n\n\n_quarto.yml\nThe _quarto.yml file can be thought of the central orchestrator for the website. It defines what website themes/CSS/SCSS to use, how the pages should be organized, and other general properties of the website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote_quarto.yml File Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n# Begin Project\nproject:\n  type: website\n  pre-render: wget -nc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/branding-resources/refs/heads/main/lmu-osc-custom.scss\n  post-render: rm lmu-osc-custom.scss\n# End Project\n\n\n# Begin Website\nwebsite:\n  title: \"TUTORIAL TITLE HERE\"\n  page-footer: \n    center: \"Copyright, 2024 Open Science Center at LMU Munich\"\n    border: false\n  search:\n    location: sidebar\n  repo-url: https://github.com/lmu-osc/REPO-NAME-HERE\n  repo-actions: [edit, issue]\n  back-to-top-navigation: true\n  page-navigation: true\n  favicon: assets/LMU_OSC_favicon.jpg\n  margin-header: |\n    ![](/assets/LMU_OSC_logo.svg){width=\"175\"}\n  \n  \n  navbar:\n    right: \n      - about.qmd\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n    tools:\n      - icon: github\n        menu:\n          - text: Source Code\n            url:  https://github.com/lmu-osc/REPO-NAME-HERE\n          - text: Report a Bug\n            url:  https://github.com/lmu-osc/REPO-NAME-HERE/issues\n      - icon: house-heart\n        url: https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/index.html\n   \n        \n  sidebar:\n    style: \"docked\"\n    contents:\n      - text: \"Overview\"\n        href: index.qmd\n      - section: \"TOPIC 1\"\n        contents:\n          - href: TOPIC1/page1.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC1 Page1 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC1/page2.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC1 Page2 Title\"\n      - section: \"TOPIC 2\"\n        contents:\n          - href: TOPIC2/page1.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page1 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC2/page2.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page2 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC2/page3.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page3 Title\"\n# End Website\n\n\n# Begin Format\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: \n      - cosmo\n      - lmu-osc-custom.scss\n    css: \n      - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/branding-resources/refs/heads/main/lmu-osc-styles.css\n    toc: true\n    fontsize: 13pt\n    code-overflow: wrap\n    grid:\n      sidebar-width: 300px\n    include-in-header:\n      - file: matomo-analytics.html\n# End Format\n\n# Begin Editor\neditor: source\n# End Editor\n\n\n\nThis is one of the more complex files in the repository, but there are only a few sections you’ll need to interact with directly.

You can add as many sections as you need–just make sure to provide them with an appropriate title. Likewise, you can include chapters under a section by listing the chapters under contents, and then providing at least an href which is a path to the chapter Quarto file.\nYou can also add a text tag directly after the href which will provide a new name for the chapter in the sidebar. However, you do not need to specify a text tag as Quarto will otherwise search for and use the value of title in your .qmd file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSidebar Options\n\n\n\n\n\n  sidebar:\n    style: \"docked\"\n    contents:\n      - text: \"Overview\"\n        href: index.qmd\n      - section: \"TOPIC 1\"\n        contents:\n          - href: TOPIC1/page1.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC1 Page1 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC1/page2.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC1 Page2 Title\"\n      - section: \"TOPIC 2\"\n        contents:\n          - href: TOPIC2/page1.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page1 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC2/page2.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page2 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC2/page3.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page3 Title\"\n\n\n\n\n\nformat\nThis section only provides additional website formatting and styling decisions, and does not need any changes.
