Commit this .RProj file and push to GitHub immediately.\nRun the command quarto publish gh-pages at the terminal, and agree to publish the site.\n\nThis will automatically activate GitHub Pages on the repo, and set the site to be deployed from the gh-pages branch on GitHub.\n\nRemove the gh-pages branch from your local computer with git branch -D gh-pages. You should not be making direct edits to this branch as it is updated by the CI/CD pipeline for publishing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can check the status of the website deployment by navigating to Actions in the repo.

The following chapters will introduce you to the basics of the lmu-osc/tutorial-template which standardizes the design of our websites, the licensing, the citation styles used, and more to provide a coherent structure across our growing catalogue of tutorials. In particular, the chapters are organized as follows:\n\nTutorial Template Overview introduces the major files and folders in the tutorial, and briefly describes the purpose of each of them.\nThings You Shouldn’t Change provides some warnings about files that should only be changed in extenuating circumstances, and how to go about doing so.\nGetting Started outlines the technical steps needed to get started with a new tutorial\nMatomo Analytics discusses our website data analytics tool, and how to include the necessary tracking code in the website.\nAuthoring and Versions covers in greater detail when and how to make updates to your project, with particular attention paid to GitHub releases and versioning of the project.\nBest Practices discusses some best practices when developing your tutorial. These are largely recommendations. (Chapter not developed yet–questioning content.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipNote on Authoring Practices, Writing Style, and Formatting\n\n\n\nWe do not prescribe how or what tutorial authors should write, obviously as long as content is within the scope of the tutorial topic.\nFeel free to stylize your content to your liking, and take advantage of Quarto features, Markdown features, and code embedded in the documents as your see fit.\nYou can, as always, tag an OSC member for review or help in pull requests or issues!"

    "title": "Things You Shouldn’t Change",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A more accurate title for this page would be “Things You Shouldn’t Change Without a Good Reason.” The following are some of the things you should be careful about changing in the project:\n\nThe GitHub Action Files\nThe publishing workflow should work out of the box for Quarto projects, and for projects that are combined with R (with or without {renv}–but please do use {renv} if your project uses R). If you need to change this workflow file, it should only be because there is genuinely an issue with the configuration or if a dependency is not installed.\nMissing system dependencies may particularly be a problem for now because, at the time of writing this in early 2025, GitHub recently changed their latest Ubuntu image to 24.04 and stripped away some dependencies that they included in the 22.02 image.\nYou’re welcome to adjust or create your own publish workflow if needed, or you can contact staff at the OSC for help.\n\n\nThe .gitignore\nThis has been set-up to ignore annoying or unneeded components of R projects/packages, Quarto projects, and files that are commonly included in repositories even though they should not be. Feel free to add more files to the .gitignore if something specific needs to be blocked or ignored, but, in general, you should not delete items from this file.\n\n\nThe _quarto.yml File\nWe aim for our tutorials to have a standard look and feel, and the _quarto.yml file is a big part of that. If you need to change this file beyond the required adjustments mentioned in previous chapters, please contact staff at the OSC for help. We’re always open for improvements to the design, but we do want to make sure any changes get applied across all tutorials.\n\n\nThe LICENSE Files\nThe license files are there to protect the intellectual property of the authors and the OSC, and should not be changed unless there are legal reasons or extenuating circumstances to do so. If you have questions about the license, please contact staff at the OSC. We’re currently working on documentation that outlines our licensing decisions in greater detail.\n\n\nThe CITATION File\nThe CITATION file is there to help others cite your work, and we have tried to select useful fields provided by the Citation File Format. As with the _quarto.yml file, we’re open to suggestions if more fields should be added, but please contact staff at the OSC before making changes.\n\n\nThe About Page\nThe yaml header in the About page is also standardized to approximately align with the CITATION file, but Quarto does not align exactly with CFF so you cannot simply copy/paste the CITATION file contents to this section.\nThe main content of the About page can be altered to add contributors notes and any other relevant authoring information that cannot be included as metadata in the yaml field. Please do not remove or change the notes about licensing on this page.\nIf you have cited other sources in your tutorial and created a bibliography, please reference the bibliography in the yaml header of this page with e.g. bibliography: your_bib_file.bib"

At the end of the day, these analytics are useful for us in 1) improving the sites to see which sites have more/less traffic than expected and 2) quantify the utility of our sites for grant purposes."

Accordingly, researchers should not only make research results freely available, for example in the form of scientific articles (open access), but also provide research data, analysis scripts and study materials. However, the reusability of the data made available requires comprehensive research data management (RDM) on the part of the researchers. In particular, research data should be made available in accordance with the FAIR principles, meaning that research data should be Findable, Accessible, and usable (Interoperable and Reusable). In this workshop, you will learn about FAIR data management in psychology by using the data management assistance system DataWiz, which allows you to plan, create and publish FAIR data objects. Specifically, you will 1) get an introduction to FAIR data documentation, 2) create a data management plan, and 3) learn how to organize your data.  Target audience: PhD students and post-docs from psychology.  Prerequisites: There is no prior knowledge required on research data management or the implementation of the FAIR principles.  To participate in the hands-on sessions, please create an account for DataWiz if you do not already have one.

For more complex events such as the Summer School, we use FormR.\nQuota  How many tickets of which kind are up for sale?\n\nAdd kind of tickets (in person/ online)\nAdd the number of tickets\nWhen to hide tickets and when not to add Info (e.g. for non LMU members)\n\nAt first, it’s only a ‘to be approved ticket’ for non LMU, with its own quota (unlimited) then Malika starts to accept some (e.g. TUM, or Munich based) and changes the LMU quota manually. Then two-three days before the event, she merges the quotas of both LMU and non LMU tickets.\nCategories  Only use it if it is a large event with a complex ticket structure. Franka is the only person to have used this yet.\nQuestions  Copy general ones from the last event.\nThese are:\n\nAttendee name (system &lt;- as ask for attendee name is ticked in general settings)\nWhat organization are you from? (list)\nWhat faculty are you from? (list)\nPlease specify: (text)\n\nEveryone should receive these questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantEvent-Specific Questions\n\n\n\nIf requested by the presenter, add those specific questions here too.\n\n\nWhich questions are mandatory depends on the event. Generally only the first few questions are required.\nAdding conditional subquestions  Add new question &gt; then go to “Advanced” settings &gt; click on “Question dependency” &gt; choose from the previous question the answer\n\n\n\nAll Orders  If tickets need to be approved they are here\nExport  Order data: download the sheet to do something With it (Malika uses this to send mails from her personal email)\nDELETE DATA IF EVEN ALLOWED TO DOWNLOAD IT\nCheck in  Not needed.\nSend out emails  If personalised emails are supposed to be sent, Malika usually does that manually.\n\n\n\nPlease also test the design and send some of the Mails to yourself by following this: Dashboard-&gt; “your ticket shop is [status]” - “click here to change” &gt; enable test mode\nFor Test Mode:\n\nGo to “Go to Shop” (right at the beginning of the page)\nTry out all possible tickets\nThen go to back to the Dashboard (View backend) &gt; “Test mode” &gt; click “Disable test mode”\n\nIn dashboard, you see ‘your ticket shop is’ then email test mode, then fake all the possible kind of orders check the emails you receive (text in email, calendar invite).  When all is good, disable test mode and delete all fake tickets (a tick box in the page to disable test mode) and check with Malika that you didn’t forget anything important. She will test again, give feedback or go online.\nTo test mails go to Arrow top left (account and organisation -&gt; settings) user settings: turn on/off notifications (New order placed -&gt; receive emails during testing)\nYou can find new projects are in the Dashboard/shop status and you can test them or set them on and offline once everything else is done.\nOther resources  Click here for information on how the mails work",

These usually are:\n\nOnline ticket - member of a LMU Unit sponsoring the Open Science Center (Psychology, Business Administration, Biology)\nOnline ticket - LMU member\nOnline ticket - non-LMU member\nIn-person ticket - member of a LMU Unit sponsoring the Open Science Center (Psychology, Business Administration, Biology)\nIn-person ticket - LMU member\nIn-person ticket - non-LMU member\n\nGeneral\n\nActive\nGive it a concise name (as in the examples above)\nAlways an Admission product for all groups\n\nPrice  Price = zero\nAvailability\n\nMost of the dates can just be taken from:\n\nWaiting list depending on event\nSale channel: online shop\n\nAllow product to be cancelled or changed is ticked here (this seems similar to the one in general settings.

For more complex events such as the Summer School, we use FormR.\nQuota  How many tickets of which kind are up for sale?\n\nAdd kind of tickets (in person/ online)\nAdd the number of tickets\nWhen to hide tickets and when not to add Info (e.g. for non LMU members)\n\nAt first, it’s only a ‘to be approved ticket’ for non LMU, with its own quota (unlimited) then Malika starts to accept some (e.g. TUM, or Munich based) and changes the LMU quota manually. Then two-three days before the event, she merges the quotas of both LMU and non LMU tickets.\nCategories  Only use it if it is a large event with a complex ticket structure. Franka is the only person to have used this yet.\nQuestions  Copy general ones from the last event.\nThese are:\n\nAttendee name (system &lt;- as ask for attendee name is ticked in general settings)\nWhat organization are you from? (list)\nWhat faculty are you from? (list)\nPlease specify: (text)\n\nEveryone should receive these questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantEvent-Specific Questions\n\n\n\nIf requested by the presenter, add those specific questions here too.\n\n\nWhich questions are mandatory depends on the event. Generally only the first few questions are required.\nAdding conditional subquestions  Add new question &gt; then go to “Advanced” settings &gt; click on “Question dependency” &gt; choose from the previous question the answer\n\n\n\nAll Orders  If tickets need to be approved they are here\nExport  Order data: download the sheet to do something With it (Malika uses this to send mails from her personal email)\nDELETE DATA IF EVEN ALLOWED TO DOWNLOAD IT\nCheck in  Not needed.\nSend out emails  If personalised emails are supposed to be sent, Malika usually does that manually.\n\n\n\nPlease also test the design and send some of the Mails to yourself by following this: Dashboard-&gt; “your ticket shop is [status]” - “click here to change” &gt; enable test mode\nFor Test Mode:\n\nGo to “Go to Shop” (right at the beginning of the page)\nTry out all possible tickets\nThen go to back to the Dashboard (View backend) &gt; “Test mode” &gt; click “Disable test mode”\n\nIn dashboard, you see ‘your ticket shop is’ then email test mode, then fake all the possible kind of orders check the emails you receive (text in email, calendar invite).  When all is good, disable test mode and delete all fake tickets (a tick box in the page to disable test mode) and check with Malika that you didn’t forget anything important. She will test again, give feedback or go online.\nTo test mails go to Arrow top left (account and organisation -&gt; settings) user settings: turn on/off notifications (New order placed -&gt; receive emails during testing)\nYou can find new projects are in the Dashboard/shop status and you can test them or set them on and offline once everything else is done.\nOther resources  Click here for information on how the mails work",

Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.\nUsing Creative Commons Public Licenses\nCreative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\nConsiderations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.\nConsiderations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.\n\n\n\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (“Public License”). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\n\nAdapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.

However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

Therefore, the existing pages can serve as templates for creating new ones.\nIf you don’t want to copy and paste an existing page, let’s go through what you need to do to create the new page in the News Folder in Fiona.\nWhat you need to change:\n\nName: This will be shown in the hyperlink so choose something short and precise which describes the content well. Depending on the category, there may be rules on how to name it e.g. just by adding a number (affected categories: Hacky Hour, Journal Club, Newsletter)\nVorlage: [Allgemein] Meldung\nTitel: This is the title of the news item so choose something short and precise:\n\nFor categories, titles are written in following style: Category: “Title”\n\nUntertitel: The subtitle mostly serves as a short description about:\n\nWho conducts the event, then write “by…” or “organised by…”\nOr What you can learn new in this event\n\nTeaserbild: Every News Item has its own icon depending on its category. You can find all icons in Fiona (named after category) by following this path: Startseite / 00 Fakultätsübergreifende Einrichtungen / eOpen Science Center / Images / News Images\n\nIcons for creating new news items: icons_for_OSC_website.pptx\n\nDatum: date of the event\n\nWhen not applicable, choose the date you publish the item.\n\n*Hauptinhalt**: The main information of the news item depends on the category (for further information see below).\n\nYou need to summarize the main information about the news. However, this depends on what you write in following structure grey box with short information at the top of the page including:\n\nWhen: date of event\nWhere: address/ zoom link\nInstructor(s): person from institution\nRegistration: pretix registration link\nMaterial: (optional) in most times osf link\nAbstract: short description of the event\nTarget audience: who should attend the event\nAgenda: what’s the time schedule for the event\nLogistics: what should you bring to the event\n\nGültig ab: Doesn’t need to be changed just be mindful that it’s a past date (which it will be when you just copy an existing news item and work with that as a template)\n\n\nCategories\n\nDiscussion\nHacky Hour\nJournal Club\nWorkshop\nInterview\nLecture\nNewsletter\nSymposium\n(not applicable): e.g. award, paper releases, job ad,…",

    "text": "One of the primary objectives of the OSC is to braoden both knowledge and practice of open science, and the online tutorials we offer are a cornerstone of this initiative. In that regard, some tutorials were brought over by our staff members from previous research institutions, and several more were commissioned between approximately 2021 and 2025.\nWhile the content from these tutorials was designed and/or adapted to fit in with the other tutorials to create a logical learning flow, the tutorials were not technically standardized. That is, the licenses, HTML/CSS formatting, citation styles, and so on were not consistent between projects. Towards the end of 2024 and through 2025 we worked to align our existing tutorials as much as possible on these issues, but this was a significant amount of work.\nWanting to avoid a repeat of this process in the future, we established a templated GitHub repository, lmu-osc/tutorial-template with all of the default settings and files we wish to have applied to our projects going forward. The core contents of this repo are generally intended to be prescriptive when creating new tutorials, outside of deciding what content should be included in the tutorial itself. Let’s explore this in more detail below."

    "text": "Important Files and Folders\n\n.gitignore\nIf you’re not familiar with .gitignore files, I recommend taking a look at this overview.\nThe included ignore file for the tutorials is a modified version of GitHub’s template for R projects with some additions to ignore Quarto specific files, namely the _site folder. Some people push this folder to their GitHub repo, and use it to serve their website from. However, we have a CI/CD workflow that will automatically render the website and serve it from the gh-pages branch.\nFor Mac users, any .DS_Store files are also automatically ignored–those should never be tracked in a git project anyway as they are local indexing files for searching the system. (Tip: run the R function usethis::git_vaccinate() if you want to globally ignore a handful of annoying files, namely .Rproj.user, .Rhistory, .Rdata, .httr-oauth, .DS_Store, and .quarto.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote.gitignore File Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n# History files\n.Rhistory\n.Rapp.history\n\n# Session Data files\n.RData\n.RDataTmp\n\n# User-specific files\n.Ruserdata\n\n# Example code in package build process\n*-Ex.R\n\n# Output files from R CMD build\n/*.tar.gz\n\n# Output files from R CMD check\n/*.Rcheck/\n\n# RStudio files\n.Rproj.user/\n\n# produced vignettes\nvignettes/*.html\nvignettes/*.pdf\n\n# OAuth2 token, see https://github.com/hadley/httr/releases/tag/v0.3\n.httr-oauth\n\n# knitr and R markdown default cache directories\n*_cache/\n/cache/\n\n# Temporary files created by R markdown\n*.utf8.md\n*.knit.md\n\n# R Environment Variables\n.Renviron\n\n# pkgdown site\ndocs/\n\n# translation temp files\npo/*~\n\n# RStudio Connect folder\nrsconnect/\n\n# Quarto\n/.quarto/\n\n# Future-proofing: ignore commonly included files that should not be tracked\n# Inspired by usethis::git_vaccinate() options\n.DS_Store\n.Rproj.user\n.httr-oauth\n.quarto\n_site/\n\n# Tutorials should pull custom.scss from our central branding repo\nlmu-osc-custom.scss\n\n\n\n\n\n.github/workflows\nThe two files contained in this directory, citation-check.yml and publish.yml, are yaml files for GitHub Actions that should run in your tutorials. The first action file checks that the formatting of your CITIATION.cff file meets requirements, and the publish.yml waits for changes on the main git branch then renders the whole website to the gh-pages branch in the repo.\nBoth workflows are from commonly available templates, but I have modified the publish.yml to have some additional executuion instructions depending on whether or not the {renv} package is used in your project. (If you have any R code included, then please do use {renv}.)\nA later chapter will talk about how to manually run these pipelines if you need/want to for any reason, and will go into more detail on the code. However, 95% of the time you will not need to make any changes to these pipelines. Just be aware that they exist, and they are doing things that should make your life easier.\n\n\nCITATION.cff\n\nBackground: Citation File Format\nThere is fairly extensive documentation online for Citation File Format, but, in short, it is a standardized method for writing citation files in a yaml format. There are hundreds of different “fields” that can be filled out like DOIs, ORCIDs, author information, institution information, and so on.\n\n\nWhy?\nThis file ultimately has three main uses for our projects:\n\nThey are needed for automated processing and the DOI generation procedure we use with Zenodo.\nGitHub recognizes these files, and will create a citation for us directly in the repo. (Not as a file, but check out the “Cite this repository” button on the right-hand side of the repository home.)\nThis helps prepare the information that goes into the about.qmd file, discussed later.\n\n\n\nOur File\nThe current version of the CITATION.cff file is listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCITATION.cff File Contents\n\n\n\n\n\ncff-version: 1.2.0\nmessage: \"If you use this software, please cite it as below.\"\nauthors:\n- family-names: \"YOUR_NAME_HERE\"\n  given-names: \"YOUR_NAME_HERE\"\n  orcid: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000\"\n  affiliation:\n    - name: \"INCLUDE RELEVANT INSTITUTION\"\n      ror: \"INCLUDE ROR LINK ID IF AVAILABLE\"\n    - name: \"INCLUDE RELEVANT INSTITUTION\"\n      ror: \"INCLUDE ROR LINK ID IF AVAILABLE\"\ntitle: \"TUTORIAL_TITLE_HERE\"\nversion: 0.0.1\ndoi: \"DOI_HERE_AFTER_GENERATED\"\ndate-released: YYYY-MM-DD\nrepository-code: \"https://github.com/lmu-osc/TUTORIAL_REPO\"\nurl: \"https://lmu-osc.github.io/TUTORIAL_REPO/\"\npreferred-citation:\n  authors:\n    - family-names: \"YOUR_LAST_NAME_HERE\"\n      given-names: \"YOUR_FIRST_NAME_HERE\"\n      orcid: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000\"\n    - family-names: \"Carberry\"\n      given-names: \"Josiah\"\n      orcid: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097\"\n  title: \"TUTORIAL_TITLE_HERE\"\n  year: YYYY\n  doi: \"10.1000/182\"\n  publisher:\n    name: \"LMU Open Science Center\"\n    ror: \"https://ror.org/029e6qe04\"\n  repository-code: \"https://github.com/lmu-osc/TUTORIAL_REPO\"\n  url: \"https://lmu-osc.github.io/TUTORIAL_REPO/\"\n  type: \"book\"\n\n\n\nFields you should pay attention to or fill out:\n\nauthors should be completed with your family (last) name, given (first) name, and an ORCID for all authors. Remove the ORCID field if you do not have one.\ntitle should be replaced with the name of the tutorial\nversion should begin with 0.0.1 following typical semantic versioning rules. Do not increase this until after making the initial Zenodo connection (discussed in a later chapter).\ndoi will remain empty inititally, but can be filled out after connecting with Zenodo\ndata-released should be the date that the current version of the repo was released\nrepository-code should be the link directly to the GitHub repository of the project\nurl should be the address for the actual websige i.e. the GitHub Pages\n\n\n\n\nLICENSES\nOur standard licenses are CC-BY-SA 4.0 for the written text and CC-0 for code contained within the tutorials. These license files are contained in LICENSE.md and LICENSE-CODE.md respectively.\n\n\nREADME.md\nThis file should follow the typical conventions of a README file in that it provides a brief overview of the project, and any particular specifications on running code or downloading additional softwares as needed.\nOtherwise, we have no strong recommendations on what to include in this file other the Zenodo DOI badge at the top of the file. (Again, this is discussed in a later chapter.)\n\n\nTOPIC* Directories\nThese two directories are just example/template spaces for where you should store your Quarto (.qmd) files. In general, we anticipate that the tutorials will be divided into 2-5 broad sections, and each section will be represented by one of these folders. Each section will contain chapters which are independent Quarto files stored within their respective folders.\nThis image illustrates how “TOPIC1” and “TOPIC2” are the different “sections” of the tutorial while the Quarto files are the different chapters.\n\n\n├── TOPIC1\n│   ├── page1.qmd\n│   └── page2.qmd\n├── TOPIC2\n│   ├── page1.qmd\n│   ├── page2.qmd\n│   ├── page3.qmd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that placing the chapter files in the respective folders will not automatically organize them into that location. You must specify which files are rendered, and where they are located in the _quarto.yml file.\n\n\n_quarto.yml\nThe _quarto.yml file can be thought of the central orchestrator for the website. It defines what website themes/CSS/SCSS to use, how the pages should be organized, and other general properties of the website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote_quarto.yml File Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n# Begin Project\nproject:\n  type: website\n  pre-render: wget -nc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/branding-resources/refs/heads/main/lmu-osc-custom.scss\n  post-render: rm lmu-osc-custom.scss\n# End Project\n\n\n# Begin Website\nwebsite:\n  title: \"TUTORIAL TITLE HERE\"\n  page-footer: \n    center: \"Copyright, 2024 Open Science Center at LMU Munich\"\n    border: false\n  search:\n    location: sidebar\n  repo-url: https://github.com/lmu-osc/REPO-NAME-HERE\n  repo-actions: [edit, issue]\n  back-to-top-navigation: true\n  page-navigation: true\n  favicon: assets/LMU_OSC_favicon.jpg\n  margin-header: |\n    ![](/assets/LMU_OSC_logo.svg){width=\"175\"}\n  \n  \n  navbar:\n    right: \n      - about.qmd\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n    tools:\n      - icon: github\n        menu:\n          - text: Source Code\n            url:  https://github.com/lmu-osc/REPO-NAME-HERE\n          - text: Report a Bug\n            url:  https://github.com/lmu-osc/REPO-NAME-HERE/issues\n      - icon: house-heart\n        url: https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/index.html\n   \n        \n  sidebar:\n    style: \"docked\"\n    contents:\n      - text: \"Overview\"\n        href: index.qmd\n      - section: \"TOPIC 1\"\n        contents:\n          - href: TOPIC1/page1.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC1 Page1 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC1/page2.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC1 Page2 Title\"\n      - section: \"TOPIC 2\"\n        contents:\n          - href: TOPIC2/page1.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page1 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC2/page2.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page2 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC2/page3.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page3 Title\"\n# End Website\n\n\n# Begin Format\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: \n      - cosmo\n      - lmu-osc-custom.scss\n    css: \n      - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/branding-resources/refs/heads/main/lmu-osc-styles.css\n    toc: true\n    fontsize: 13pt\n    code-overflow: wrap\n    grid:\n      sidebar-width: 300px\n    include-in-header:\n      - file: matomo-analytics.html\n# End Format\n\n# Begin Editor\neditor: source\n# End Editor\n\n\n\nThis is one of the more complex files in the repository, but there are only a few sections you’ll need to interact with directly.

The details of this are in a footnote below1, but, in short, this is done to ensure that the same branding is added to all of our repos and so that we can just make branding changes to one repo in the future (rather than all of our tutorials.)\n\n\nwebsite\nThis is the section you will interact with the most (and almost exclusively) when developing your project. This will be subdivided into 3 sections: a general section, the navbar, and the sidebar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAll website Options\n\n\n\n\n\n# Begin Website\nwebsite:\n  title: \"TUTORIAL TITLE HERE\"\n  page-footer: \n    center: \"Copyright, 2024 Open Science Center at LMU Munich\"\n    border: false\n  search:\n    location: sidebar\n  repo-url: https://github.com/lmu-osc/REPO-NAME-HERE\n  repo-actions: [edit, issue]\n  back-to-top-navigation: true\n  page-navigation: true\n  favicon: assets/LMU_OSC_favicon.jpg\n  margin-header: |\n    ![](/assets/LMU_OSC_logo.svg){width=\"175\"}\n  \n  \n  navbar:\n    right: \n      - about.qmd\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n    tools:\n      - icon: github\n        menu:\n          - text: Source Code\n            url:  https://github.com/lmu-osc/REPO-NAME-HERE\n          - text: Report a Bug\n            url:  https://github.com/lmu-osc/REPO-NAME-HERE/issues\n      - icon: house-heart\n        url: https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/index.html\n   \n        \n  sidebar:\n    style: \"docked\"\n    contents:\n      - text: \"Overview\"\n        href: index.qmd\n      - section: \"TOPIC 1\"\n        contents:\n          - href: TOPIC1/page1.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC1 Page1 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC1/page2.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC1 Page2 Title\"\n      - section: \"TOPIC 2\"\n        contents:\n          - href: TOPIC2/page1.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page1 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC2/page2.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page2 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC2/page3.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page3 Title\"\n# End Website\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Options\nFields you should update or pay attention to:\n\ntitle should be the actual project title\nrepo-url should be the URL directly to the GitHub repo\npage-footer please update the year in the copyright if needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGeneral Website Options\n\n\n\n\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"TUTORIAL TITLE HERE\"\n  page-footer: \n    center: \"Copyright, 2024 Open Science Center at LMU Munich\"\n    border: false\n  search:\n    location: sidebar\n  repo-url: https://github.com/lmu-osc/REPO-NAME-HERE\n  repo-actions: [edit, issue]\n  back-to-top-navigation: true\n  page-navigation: true\n  favicon: assets/LMU_OSC_favicon.jpg\n  margin-header: |\n    ![](/assets/LMU_OSC_logo.svg){width=\"175\"}\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nnavbar\nThis section is for specifying the navbar or navigation bar at the top of the window.

You can add as many sections as you need–just make sure to provide them with an appropriate title. Likewise, you can include chapters under a section by listing the chapters under contents, and then providing at least an href which is a path to the chapter Quarto file.\nYou can also add a text tag directly after the href which will provide a new name for the chapter in the sidebar. However, you do not need to specify a text tag as Quarto will otherwise search for and use the value of title in your .qmd file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSidebar Options\n\n\n\n\n\n  sidebar:\n    style: \"docked\"\n    contents:\n      - text: \"Overview\"\n        href: index.qmd\n      - section: \"TOPIC 1\"\n        contents:\n          - href: TOPIC1/page1.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC1 Page1 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC1/page2.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC1 Page2 Title\"\n      - section: \"TOPIC 2\"\n        contents:\n          - href: TOPIC2/page1.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page1 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC2/page2.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page2 Title\"\n          - href: TOPIC2/page3.qmd\n            text: \"TOPIC2 Page3 Title\"\n\n\n\n\n\nformat\nThis section only provides additional website formatting and styling decisions, and does not need any changes. (However, if you think there are broad styling changes or additions we should make for all of our tutorials, feel free to open an issue or a PR!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFormat Options\n\n\n\n\n\n# Begin Format\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: \n      - cosmo\n      - lmu-osc-custom.scss\n    css: \n      - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmu-osc/branding-resources/refs/heads/main/lmu-osc-styles.css\n    toc: true\n    fontsize: 13pt\n    code-overflow: wrap\n    grid:\n      sidebar-width: 300px\n    include-in-header:\n      - file: matomo-analytics.html\n# End Format\n\n\n\n\n\neditor\nWhen editing the project in RStudio, this determines whether Quarto documents will open up in source or visual mode by default.

This is in contrast to the CSS file which can simply be read from somewhere on the web, and is the reason why we are able to specify the css parameter as just a link to our central branding repo.↩︎"

    "text": "When to version?\n\nMoving Beyond v0.0.1\nIf you followed the earlier instructions, the initial version of your project should always be v0.0.1. This version contains essentially no content, and only some technical/set-up files. But what should constitute your first “release” after this? When have you moved up a version?\nYou could, for example, increment the patch numbers to e.g. v0.0.2, v0.0.3, … as you add and refine sections or chapters to your tutorial. However, this becomes tedious, and doesn’t reflect the reality of jumping between chapters as we develop, expanding upon and deleting chapters, and so on.\nMy rule of thumb is, in the early and initial stages of development, that it’s okay to be a little bit fast and dirty with the versioning: only bother to reversion when you are at the point that your first minor release, i.e. v0.1.0, seems like it would be reasonable. And a minor release is probably reasonable around the time that you would ask another OSC member to review a (nearly) completed draft.\n\n\nMoving Beyond v0.1.X\nAt the stage of v0.1.X, there will likely be several rounds of review and refinement. How and when should reviews be incremented?\n\nPatches: if primarily text, grammar, and other small adjustments are made to the tutorial, increment by just a patch.\nMinor: if large chunks of a chapter or chapters are added, removed, or relocated, increment by a minor release.\nMajor: the first major release should occur around the time the tutorial goes live for e.g. the first workshop. This might not hold universally, but is a good rule-of-thumb for when a tutorial is “finalized.”"

    "text": "LinkedIn\nHere are some general tips for navigating LinkedIn:\n\nWord limit for posts: 3000\nWhen including a link in a post, LinkedIn changes it to a link format only recognizable on the platform. So, do NOT copy and paste this link from the LinkedIn post to share elsewhere, get the actual link from the source.\nWhen you make a post on LinkedIn, do not ‘Like’ it from your personal LinkedIn account as an OSC staff member. This prevents the algorithm from promoting it and it would get pushed down.\nPosts with high-quality pictures get better engagement. For posts about things like events, talks, big meetings- try and get pictures to post on the social media.\n\nIf you are are present at the event, try to get pictures of what’s happening or ask if anyone would be willing to take a picture for the social media posts.\nIf you will not be present, contact the people who will be there ahead of time and ask if they could take pictures for a social media post (contact them 1-3 days before to remind them).",

This makes it better for persons to share or repost the resource and the context around it\n\nIf you can, make the post with the resource one that can standalone so that when it’s reposted, people have the important details in that initial post of the thread.",
