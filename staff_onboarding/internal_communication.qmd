## Email and Matrix

These are our main communication channels.

**E-Mail**

**Getting an LMU.de email** Malika will submit a ticket with IT to get you an email under the lmu.de domain. Access this mailbox by going to [xmail.mwn.de](https://xmail.mwn.de).

Please use emails for important messages to keep in record, or for to-dos that can’t be dealt with immediately.

## Personal Email

It's still fine to communicate with staff through your personal email and for using Google Workspace platforms.
:::

**Matrix**

Matrix is the preferred way for back and forth communication, FYIs, or for small to-dos that can be dealt with immediately.

**LMU chat** [Click here for the detailed instructions](https://www.lmu.de/en/about-lmu/structure/central-university-administration/it-services-division-vi/it-service-desk/central-it-services/lmu-chat-matrix/) to install your desktop and phone apps to be able to chat with anybody from the LMU. [Click here for the direct invitation](https://matrix.to/#/#lmu-open-science-center:matrix.lmu.de) to our workspace.

## Setting up a Meeting

To find a good time to meet for all invitees, you can use [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com/) or [TerminPlaner](https://terminplaner6.dfn.de/), depending on whether you want to show entire days or just a few specific time options respectively.

## Calendar Invitation

Once set, please send a calendar invitation with a zoom link (ICS attachment or outlook or Gmail calendar invitation).
:::

## Zoom

If you don’t have a Zoom pro account, please request one at the [Help Desk](https://helpdesk.fak11.lmu.de/). Then contact central IT: it-servicedesk\@lmu.de and ask fak11 to add zoom webinar Pro (for Open Science Summer School) so that Malika can add you as an alternative host to the OSC events should she be sick and need you to launch and possibly chair the meeting.

Log in to the Zoom account with the lmu.de email and LRZ SSO credentials to activate it. The company domain is: https://lmu-munich.zoom.us/

## Office

The shared office space is in Room 3321. You can open the door to the office with a transponder that Malika will request.

The office also holds important OSC equipment (360 cameras, tripod, microphone, laptop, poster) and access to a printer. The equipment is in the grey locker and can be accessed with the key in Malika's desk drawer.
