We use several platforms that allow us to share our work and collaborate on projects.

## Google Docs

Always create the Google Doc in the [Work with Assistants](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WxLB_xM4eN8GsSdGrfw6DnW8QqlZ33av) folder. 

When you create a new Google Doc:

- Set it so that "anyone with the link can comment"
- Add the OSC team (Malika and assistants) as editors
- Transfer ownership to Malika so it can stay within the LMU OSC - Work with Assistants folder

Please share the link of the document you created here:

- At the top of each relevant section in the todo
- In the task table
- In the right folder

Tips for organizing the Google Doc:

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/Google_Doc_Styles.png){width="50%" fig-alt="A screenshot of the text style options within a Google Doc."}
:::
::: {.column width="70%"}

- Use the 'Styles' option to create headings within the document.
- The headings appear in the navigation bar on the left-side of the document to help you get an overview of and click through the document contents.

How to set the style of the headings:

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/Google_Doc_Heading.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the text style options with the 'Heading 2' option highlighted."}
:::
::: {.column width="70%"}

- Format the text in the way you want the Heading to look (font size, color, italics, bold, etc.)
- Highlight this text in the document 
- In the Styles menu, hover over the desired heading category and select "Update 'Heading' to match"
- The text you highlighted will now be how these headings are formatted (e.g. if you updated Heading 2, this will be how all text styled as 'Heading 2' will be formatted).
