## Individual Members 

**How will you know when to add a member to the page?**

Malika will send you an email containing all the relevant information from the person themselves. If any information is missing, let Malika know and she will either get the information or give further instructions. 

**How to add a new individual member to the page?**

Follow this path in Fiona: `Startseite / 00 Fakultätsübergreifende Einrichtungen / eOpen Science Center / Members / Individual Members`

- Depending on which kind of member, open the respective folder (LMU, Associated, Past, Fellows)
- Copy a folder of an already existing member by clicking on that folder and then clicking the “Kopieren” sign( next to the scissors at the top)
- Click on the respective members folder from the beginning again and paste the copied folder by clicking the “Einfügen” sign (next to the “copy” sign at the top)
